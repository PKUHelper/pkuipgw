```

## Quick Start

Connect to IP Gateway.
```bash
$ pkuipgw c -u 14000XXXXX -p ********
```

You would see an output like the following one if the connection success.
```text
Connection success!
Status:
  connection_count  2
  balance           357.314
  ip                10.2.50.0
```

You could also use the full action command or full option. `--long-opt=ARG` is equivalent to `--long-opt "ARG"`. 
```bash
$ pkuipgw connect --user-id 14000XXXXX --password=********
```

Store the user id and password on local.
```bash
$ pkuipgw config -u 14000XXXXX -p ********
```

Once setup is completed, you would no longer need to input the user id or password.
```bash
$ pkuipgw c # no need to specify the user id or password now
```

Disconnect.
```bash
$ pkuipgw d
```
Disconnect all.
```bash
$ pkuipgw d -a
```

Disconnect the connection with specific ip.
```bash
$ pkuipgw d --ip=192.168.0.1
```
\[WARNING\] The server of PKU Computer Center does not validate the ip you request.
Passing a wrong ip may lead to weird output. 
We are not able to guarantee the output shows what exactly happens every time. 

Show the list of current connections.
```bash
$ pkuipgw l
```
